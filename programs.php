<p>The Rainbow Homes Program provides an opportunity for girls, who formerly lived on the streets, to live and study in a safe, non-custodial, residential environment. It secures their basic rights and ensures their reintegration into mainstream society. The girls are enrolled in regular school programs and age appropriate classes, usually after a short period of remedial coaching.</p>
<p>After they reach the age of 16years they are given Career Counselling and Life Skill classes. Those who finish their board examinations (Classes X and XII) attend a Summer English and Computer Programme.</p>
<p>After the age of 18 years the young adults are helped to transition from the Homes by engaging them in suitable Vocational Trainning  and helping them to get jobs and accommodation.</p>
